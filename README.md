# CE2103 Object Oriented Programming Course with Java :computer: :books:

This repository contains all materials related to the CE2103 Object Oriented (OO) Programming Course using Java. The course explores the software coding paradigm of OO programming and is practically implemented using a cross-platform Java compiler. The core concepts covered in this course include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. We kick off with Java basics and gradually delve into advanced concepts like class design, object instances, data encapsulation, and operator overloading. 

The course is a comprehensive guide to OO programming in Java, starting from basic syntax to complex concepts of inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism. Here's a quick look at the course structure:

Chapter 1 provides an overview of the historical development of computers, the basics of computer programs, and an introduction to Java programming.

## Chapter-2: Elementary Programming with Java :baby:

Here we learn about the fundamentals of programming with Java. The chapter covers the basic syntax, data structures, operators, identifiers, variables, Numeric data types, type casting, and augmented operators.

## Chapter-3: Selections :arrow_right: :arrow_left:

Dive into the world of if-statements. Learn about two-way if-else statements, nested if statements, and multi-way if-else statements.

## Chapter-4: Mathematical Functions, Characters, and Strings :abacus:

This chapter explores various mathematical functions, character manipulations, and string operations in Java.

## Chapter-5: Loops :repeat:

Learn all about looping structures in Java - the while loop, the do-while loop, the for loop, and nested loops.

## Chapter-6: Methods in Java :wrench:

Methods are the heart of Java programming. This chapter will help you understand and implement various types of methods in Java.

Get a hands-on experience with arrays. Understand the concept, declaration, and implementation of single-dimensional  in Java.

## Chapter-8:Multidimensional Arrays :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Get a hands-on experience with arrays. Understand the concept, declaration, and implementation of multidimensional arrays in Java.

## Chapter-9: Objects and Classes :building_construction:

Start with the basics of class design, object instances, and data encapsulation (public, private, protected). 

## Chapter-10: Object-Oriented Thinking :bulb:

This chapter dives deep into the philosophy of Object-Oriented Programming. It will set the stage for understanding complex OO concepts.

## Chapter-11: Inheritance and Polymorphism in Java :dna:

Explore the powerful concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in Java. Learn about interfaces, up/downcasting, and their use cases.

## Chapter-12: Exception Handling and Text I/O :warning:

The final chapter of the course will guide you through exception handling in Java. You'll also learn how to perform text input/output operations.
